# landing_page
Hello,
This is the final project of the CSS chapter. My goal is to recreate the landing page provided by TOP(The Odin Project).

I will try to simplify this process to 2 main parts:

1_create the Html
2_style it 

I'll create and describe the html to the fullest so that i dont have to change it at all while styling it. Next Im going to flesh out the shape and color of the different segments in the page. After that I'll stylize the contents of each segment so that they fit nicely in their containers. Finally i will adress the stylings of text, the placeholder images and whatever finishing touches I might need.
