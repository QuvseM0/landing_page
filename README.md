# landing_page
Hello,
This is the final project of the CSS chapter. My goal is to recreate the landing page provided by TOP(The Odin Project).

Due to my restricted free time I will try to simplify this process to 2 assymetrical main parts:

1_create the Html (done)
2_style it (in process)

The way im organizing myself is what im actually trying to improve as i have already estabilished in the previous exercises that i am indeed capable of performing this task. My main problem is organization, as i've tried starting different mini projects, and the exercises themselves, and due to bad organization everything takes way longer than expected.
To fix this I'll create and describe the html to the fullest so that i dont have to change it at all while styling it. Next Im going to flesh out the shape and color of the different segments in the page. After that I'll stylize the contents of each segment so that they fit nicely in their containers. Finally i will adress the stylings of text, the placeholder images and whatever finishing touches I might need.
I think this organization will help me to make this whole process easy to replicate and hopefully ground my workflow so that i can confidently create orrecreate any page i might need.
